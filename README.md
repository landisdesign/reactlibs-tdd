# reactlibs-tdd

The previous project, [`reactlibs-ts`](https://github.com/landisdesign/reactlibs-ts),
helped me understand more about TypeScript and class-based components, but I
felt the need to hurry and focus specifically on those aspects without
considering methodologies. My previous work experience didn't stress TDD, so I
drawn to focus time and efforts on drilling this into my way of thinking.
